# Backend System using Node.js

## A backend API that serves as an endpoint to a frontend system, empowering it to act as a hub for the Port Community System (PCS)


## Project Overview

### The aim of this project is to address a significant issue at the Port of Alexandria, Egypt. Currently, the port lacks a unified main system that allows all members of the Port Community System (PCS) to communicate via API endpoints. This project seeks to digitalize transactions among PCS members and customs brokers, facilitating seamless, faster, and more efficient operations. This solution not only enhances speed but also reduces costs and improves the quality of service.
